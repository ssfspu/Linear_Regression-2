Property Assessments 

Problem Statement(s):

Problem 2.42 Page 95

Property assessments. The data that follow show assessed value for property tax purposes (Y" in thousand dollars) and sales price (Y2, in thousand dollars) for a sample of 15 parcels of land for industrial development sold recently in "arm's length" transactions in a tax district. Assume that bivariate normal model (2.74) is appropriate here.

a. Plot the data in a scatter diagram. Does the bivariate normal model appear to be appropriate here? Discuss.

b. Calculate r,2. What parameter is estimated by r,2? What is the interpretation of this parameter?

c. TestwhetherornotY,andY2arestatisticallyindependentinthepopulation,usingteststatis- tic (2.87) and level of significance .01. State the alternatives, decision rule, and conclusion.

d. To test P'2 = .6 versus P'2 1= .6, would it be appropriate to use test statistic (2.87)?

Problem: 2.47 Page 97

a. Obtain the Spearman rank correlation coefficient rs.

b. Test by means of the Spearman rank correlation coefficient whether an association exists between property assessments and sales prices using test statistic (2.101) with a = .01. State the alternatives, decision rule, and conclusion.

c. How do your estimates and conclusions in parts (a) and (b) compare to those obtained in Problem 2.42?
