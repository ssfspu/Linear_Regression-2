#Property assessments:The data that follow show assessed value for property tax purposes (Y" in thousand dollars) and sales price (Y2, in thousand dollars) for a sample of 15 parcels of land for industrial development sold recently in "arm's length" transactions in a tax district.Assume that bivariate normal model (2.74) is appropriate here.

```{r}

property_data <- read.table("http://www.stat.ufl.edu/~rrandles/sta4210/Rclassnotes/data/textdatasets/KutnerData/Chapter%20%202%20Data%20Sets/CH02PR42.txt",header=FALSE,sep="",col.names=c("Tax","Sales_Price"))

attach(property_data)
head(property_data);dim(property_data) 
n<-15

#a. Plot the data in a scatter diagram. Does the bivariate normal model 
#appear to be appropriate here? Discuss.
plot(Tax,Sales_Price,main="Scatter Plot of the Data",ylab="Sales Price")

mean1 <-mean(Tax)
var1<-sum((Tax-mean1)^2)/n
sd1<-sqrt(var1)
mean2 <-mean(Sales_Price)
var2<-sum((Sales_Price-mean2)^2)/n
sd2<-sqrt(var2)

sd12 <- mean((Tax-mean1)*(Sales_Price-mean2))


(cor12<-sd12/(sd1*sd2))# coefficient of determination

#Since the r^2 is not equal to zero, it means that variable are dependent.
#Here Y1 tends to be large when Y2 is large and also sd12 is positive so 
#the rho12 is also positive.


#b. Calculate r^2. What parameter is estimated by r^2? What is the 
#interpretation of this parameter?

paste("Coefficient of determination is",round(cor12,4))

#c. Test whether or not Y1,and Y2 are statistically independent in the 
#population, using test statistic (2.87) and level of significance .01. 
#State the alternatives, decision rule, and conclusion.

#H0: rho12=0
#Ha: rho12 !=0

tstar <- cor12*sqrt(n-2)/sqrt(1-(cor12)^2)

qt(1-.01/2,n-2)
#if t* <= 3.012276 conclude ho
#if t* > 3.012276 conclude ha
#Since t* >3.012276, we reject the null hypothesis and accept the 
#alternate hypotheis.

#d. To test P12 = .6 versus P12 != .6, would it be appropriate to use test 
#statistic (2.87)?

#No, it wouldn't be appropriate to use the test statistics

#a. Obtain the Spearman rank correlation coefficient rs.

#Method 1 to calculate the Spearman Rank Order Coefficient
r1 <- rank(Tax)
r2 <- rank(Sales_Price)
d <- r1-r2
d_sqr <- d^2
n<-15
sp.rhou <- 1 - ((6*sum(d_sqr))/(n*(n^2-1)))

#Method 2 to calculate the Spearman Rank Order Coefficient
r1 <- rank(Tax)
r2 <- rank(Sales_Price)
r1.bar<-mean(r1)
r2.bar<-mean(r2)
sp.rhou2<-(sum((r1-r1.bar)*(r2-r2.bar)))/(sum((r1-r1.bar)^2)*sum((r2-r2.bar)^2))


#b. Test by means of the Spearman rank correlation coefficient whether an 
#association exists between property assessments and sales prices using 
#test statistic (2.101) with alha = .01. State the alternatives, decision 
#rule, and conclusion.

#The Spearman rank correlation coefficient can be used to test the 
#alternatives:
#Ho: There is no association between YI and Y2
#Ha: There is association between YI and Y2
#Two sided test is required since Ha includes either positive or negative 
#association.

#if t* is less than t(1-alpha/2,n-2) conclude ho
#if t* is greater than t(1-alpha/2,n-2) conclude ha

tstar <- sp.rhou*sqrt(n-2)/sqrt(1-sp.rhou^2)

#for alpha = .01 
(t<-qt(1-.01/2,n-2))

2*pt(2.79,df=22)
#Since tstar > t-crtical, we conclude Ha,that there is a association 
#between Tax variable and Sales Price variable

#c. How do your estimates and conclusions in parts (a) and (b) compare to those obtained in Problem 2.42?
